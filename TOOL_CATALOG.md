# Cortex MCP Tool Catalog

This catalog documents the tools exposed by the Cortex MCP Server, detailing their mathematical models, data sources, and architectural philosophies.

## Core Philosophy

### Graceful Degradation
Tools must prioritize availability over absolute completeness. If a tool expects secondary data (e.g., `/etc/os-release` for the OS name) but cannot find it, it should return `"unknown"` or an empty string rather than failing the execution. Hard failures (`IsSupported() = false`) should be reserved for scenarios where the fundamental operation of the tool is impossible (e.g., a required binary is missing, or the core sysfs tree does not exist).

### Role-Based Tool Activation
Tools are dynamically registered based on the specialized storage roles of the node they run on. The `internal/registry.DetectNodeRoles()` engine determines these capabilities by inspecting sysfs:

- **SFA Controllers**: Detected via the presence of `/sys/module/jsysdd`, `/sys/class/jsys`, `/sys/module/jnvme`, or `/sys/class/jnvme`.
- **Lustre MGS**: Detected via active instances in `/sys/fs/lustre/mgs/`.
- **Lustre MDS**: Detected via active targets in `/sys/fs/lustre/mdt/`.
- **Lustre OSS**: Detected via active targets in `/sys/fs/lustre/obdfilter/`.
- **Lustre Client**: Detected via active mounts in `/sys/fs/lustre/llite/`.

A single physical node can represent any combination of these roles (e.g., an SFA storage controller running hyperconverged MGS + MDS + OSS targets). If no specialized roles are detected, the node is classified as **`generic`** and only core diagnostic tools will be advertised.

## Tool Definitions

### `system_info`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Gathers foundational telemetry about the host system. This tool is designed to run universally on any Linux environment, including minimal containers and heavily stripped OS deployments.

**Data Sources:**
- **Hostname**: Retrieved via standard OS calls (`os.Hostname()`).
- **CPUs**: Number of logical cores reported by the Go runtime (`runtime.NumCPU()`).
- **Kernel Version**: Read directly from `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`.
- **OS Distribution**: Parsed from `/etc/os-release`, prioritizing the `PRETTY_NAME` field and falling back to `ID`.

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` will only return `false` if the host operating system is not Linux.
- If `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease` or `/etc/os-release` are missing or unreadable, the tool degrades gracefully by returning `"unknown"` or empty strings. It does not return execution errors for missing data.

### `uptime`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Reads and calculates system uptime and CPU idle time. Formats the data into pre-processed human-readable strings to reduce the mathematical overhead for LLMs consuming the API.

**Data Sources:**
- **Uptime/Idle**: Read from `/proc/uptime`. The first value is the total system uptime, and the second is the total idle time across all CPUs.
- **CPU Count**: Number of logical cores reported by the Go runtime (`runtime.NumCPU()`).

**Mathematical Models:**
- **Idle Percentage**: Calculated dynamically as `(IdleSeconds / (UptimeSeconds * CPUCount)) * 100.0`.
- **Human Readable Format**: Converts seconds into a comma-separated duration string (e.g., `4 days, 1 hours, 25 minutes, 35 seconds`).

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` returns `false` if the host OS is not Linux, or if `/proc/uptime` is unreadable/missing.
- If the system is so fresh or constrained that uptime/CPU math would cause a division by zero, the tool fails gracefully or reports 0% idle.

### `loadavg`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Reads the system load averages and scheduling entity statistics to provide a snapshot of system CPU and I/O pressure.

**Data Sources:**
- Read directly from `/proc/loadavg`.

**Mathematical Models:**
- Directly extracts the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages.
- Parses the scheduling entity ratio (e.g., `1/863`) into two distinct integers: `RunnableEntities` and `TotalEntities`.

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` returns `false` if the host OS is not Linux, or if `/proc/loadavg` is unreadable/missing.
