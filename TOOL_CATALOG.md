# Cortex MCP Tool Catalog

This catalog documents the tools exposed by the Cortex MCP Server, detailing their mathematical models, data sources, and architectural philosophies.

## Core Philosophy

### Graceful Degradation
Tools must prioritize availability over absolute completeness. If a tool expects secondary data (e.g., `/etc/os-release` for the OS name) but cannot find it, it should return `"unknown"` or an empty string rather than failing the execution. Hard failures (`IsSupported() = false`) should be reserved for scenarios where the fundamental operation of the tool is impossible (e.g., a required binary is missing, or the core sysfs tree does not exist).

### Role-Based Tool Activation
Tools are dynamically registered based on the specialized storage roles of the node they run on. The `internal/registry.DetectNodeRoles()` engine determines these capabilities by inspecting sysfs:

- **SFA Controllers**: Detected via the presence of `/sys/module/jsysdd`, `/sys/class/jsys`, `/sys/module/jnvme`, or `/sys/class/jnvme`.
- **Lustre MGS**: Detected via active instances in `/sys/fs/lustre/mgs/`.
- **Lustre MDS**: Detected via active targets in `/sys/fs/lustre/mdt/`.
- **Lustre OSS**: Detected via active targets in `/sys/fs/lustre/obdfilter/`.
- **Lustre Client**: Detected via active mounts in `/sys/fs/lustre/llite/`.

A single physical node can represent any combination of these roles (e.g., an SFA storage controller running hyperconverged MGS + MDS + OSS targets). If no specialized roles are detected, the node is classified as **`generic`** and only core diagnostic tools will be advertised.

## Tool Definitions

### `system_info`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Gathers foundational telemetry about the host system. This tool is designed to run universally on any Linux environment, including minimal containers and heavily stripped OS deployments.

**Data Sources:**
- **Hostname**: Retrieved via standard OS calls (`os.Hostname()`).
- **CPUs**: Number of logical cores reported by the Go runtime (`runtime.NumCPU()`).
- **Kernel Version**: Read directly from `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease`.
- **OS Distribution**: Parsed from `/etc/os-release`, prioritizing the `PRETTY_NAME` field and falling back to `ID`.
- **Node Roles**: Detected via `registry.DetectNodeRoles()`, which inspects sysfs paths for SFA controllers, Lustre MGS/MDS/OSS targets, and mounted Lustre clients. Returns `["generic"]` when no specialized roles are detected.
- **Role Info**: Detailed `NodeRoleInfo` struct with per-target lists (e.g., active MDTs, OSTs, mounted filesystems).

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` will only return `false` if the host operating system is not Linux.
- If `/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease` or `/etc/os-release` are missing or unreadable, the tool degrades gracefully by returning `"unknown"` or empty strings. If no Lustre/SFA sysfs paths exist, `roles` returns `["generic"]` — the tool never errors.

### `uptime`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Reads and calculates system uptime and CPU idle time. Formats the data into pre-processed human-readable strings to reduce the mathematical overhead for LLMs consuming the API.

**Data Sources:**
- **Uptime/Idle**: Read from `/proc/uptime`. The first value is the total system uptime, and the second is the total idle time across all CPUs.
- **CPU Count**: Number of logical cores reported by the Go runtime (`runtime.NumCPU()`).

**Mathematical Models:**
- **Idle Percentage**: Calculated dynamically as `(IdleSeconds / (UptimeSeconds * CPUCount)) * 100.0`.
- **Human Readable Format**: Converts seconds into a comma-separated duration string (e.g., `4 days, 1 hours, 25 minutes, 35 seconds`).

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` returns `false` if the host OS is not Linux, or if `/proc/uptime` is unreadable/missing.
- If the system is so fresh or constrained that uptime/CPU math would cause a division by zero, the tool fails gracefully or reports 0% idle.

### `loadavg`
*Category: Core Diagnostics*

Reads the system load averages and scheduling entity statistics to provide a snapshot of system CPU and I/O pressure.

**Data Sources:**
- Read directly from `/proc/loadavg`.

**Mathematical Models:**
- Directly extracts the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages.
- Parses the scheduling entity ratio (e.g., `1/863`) into two distinct integers: `RunnableEntities` and `TotalEntities`.

**Degradation Profile:**
- `IsSupported()` returns `false` if the host OS is not Linux, or if `/proc/loadavg` is unreadable/missing.

## Meta-Tools

These tools operate at the MCP gateway level, not on individual nodes. They aggregate data from the entire mesh.

### `cluster_overview`
*Category: Fleet Intelligence*

Provides a complete cluster topology in a single call. Fans out `system_info` and `mesh_topology` to every node in the mesh, then aggregates the results at the gateway.

**Algorithm:**
1. **Fan-out `system_info`** to `*` (all nodes) — collects hostname, OS, arch, CPUs, kernel, distro, and detected storage roles from every node.
2. **Fan-out `mesh_topology`** to `*` (all nodes) — collects each node's direct peers, impedance costs, next-hop routing, and capabilities.
3. **Edge deduplication**: For every node's report, extracts `IsDirect=true` entries. If node A reports B as a direct peer and B reports A as a direct peer, they collapse to a single undirected edge. The union of all direct-peer relationships produces the **complete mesh graph**.
4. **Role count aggregation**: Counts occurrences of each role (SFA, MGS, MDS, OSS, Client, Generic) across all nodes.
5. **Mermaid rendering**: Generates a `graph TD` diagram from the real edge set, with nodes colored by primary role.

**Output includes:**
- `total_nodes`: Number of nodes in the fleet.
- `role_counts`: Map of role → count (e.g., `{"mgs": 4, "mds": 10, "oss": 100, "client": 1000, "generic": 2}`).
- `nodes[]`: Per-node detail (hostname, roles, OS, CPUs, impedance from gateway, direct/transitive status, next-hop, tools).
- `edges[]`: Deduplicated direct connections between nodes.
- `mermaid_graph`: Pre-rendered Mermaid diagram string.

**Degradation Profile:**
- Requires a live mesh with at least one connected node to produce meaningful results.
- Nodes that fail to respond to the fan-out are omitted from the topology (no error propagation).
- Returns sensible defaults (`total_nodes: 0`, empty arrays) for an empty mesh.
